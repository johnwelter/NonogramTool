two modes - puzzle mode and picture mode

puzzle mode should allow a paint like system - click and drag, overwriting buttons with last color set
(IE click a black button which switches it to white, hold and drag to cause all moused-over buttons with white)

picture mode- big jum pin quality of program, might jsut use NESST to create the images

in fact- allow extract of buttons as a nametable, allow as import into nesst


            //when puzzle is finished, wipe all but the puzzle tiles away
            //scroll to center image
            //drwa in new image, grey scale only (color might be too hard, currently
            //maybe set up a monochrome pallete?
