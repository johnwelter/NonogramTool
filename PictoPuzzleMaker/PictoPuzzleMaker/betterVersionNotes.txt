have everything save out to a given location relavtive to the program, and put the program in the game files folder

when hitting export, overwrite the existing files 

should be able from there to hit make/open the game


file organization
- load up a bank file (a JSON file)
- bank file includes list of puzzles
- puzzles are made up of raw bytes, and are what would be the final export to be     used in game
- something like:
	<bank>
	   <puzzle_1>
		<bytes....>
	   <pussle_2>
		<bytes....>

- a bank file has ONLY 27 puzzles, all initially empty puzzles
- puzzles are listed in a list
- select puzzle on list, hit load
- pop up to ask if you want to save current puzzle
- load puzzle info from bytes into grids
- edit puzzle grids
- save 
- select next puzzle
- etc
- hit export to export full bank bin file and bank ASM
- keep track of puzzle bytes, and total byte count
- don't allow export if byte count is higher than 8k (shouldn't be a problem)
